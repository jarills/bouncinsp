BouncinSP
=========

Tool for automatic tracking/exporting of patterns made on Roland SP samplers (SP-404SX only for now).

By jarills, 2013.

----------------

Beta version (0.2).

Features:

- Supports SP-404SX patterns, samples and song information
- Single pattern export into individual tracks
- Setting a repeat (loop) count
- Keeping tails of samples after loop end
- Option to normalize each track
- Renaming patterns and using those names as a naming scheme for files
- Naming scheme: track_PATTERN_PAD_BARCOUNT.wav
- Graphical view of the pattern
- Gate, Loop, Reverse playback modes (no Lofi)

----------------

TODO and possible features in future versions:

Rendering:

- stereo export option (mixdown)
- Lofi fake, but better to do in the DAW
- support for changing the BPM (is that useful?)

Audio:

- preview pattern through audio interface
